## ✅ High-Priority Projects to Study

### 🔗 [PyBroker](https://github.com/edtechre/pybroker)
> A complete backtesting and ML integration framework for trading.
- ⭐ Strengths: Walk-forward testing, supports custom ML models (sklearn, xgboost, etc.)
- 📌 Plan: Study RSI + Linear Regression notebook and customize strategy.
- 🔧 Status: Cloned and running locally.
